Description: Implements the navigated weighting (NAWT) proposed by Katsumata (2020)
    <arXiv:2005.10998>, which improves the inverse probability weighting by 
    utilizing estimating equations suitable for a specific pre-specified parameter 
    of interest (e.g., the average treatment effects or the average treatment 
    effects on the treated) in propensity score estimation. It includes the 
    covariate balancing propensity score proposed by Imai and Ratkovic (2014), 
    which uses covariate balancing conditions in propensity score estimation. 
    The point estimate of the parameter of interest as well as coefficients for 
    propensity score estimation and their uncertainty are produced using the 
    M-estimation. The same functions can be used to estimate average outcomes in 
    missing outcome cases.
